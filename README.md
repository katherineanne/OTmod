# Unnaming the Oregon Trail

A very simple Oregon Trail mod that I made for DHUM 450. My goal was to procedurally recreate the argument Thomas King makes in his book, *The Inconvenient Indian*. King argues that Indigenous peoples have been erased from mainstream North American history, he then reinsert a "Native" presence throughout his retelling of that history. This game, likewise, priviledges the indigenous presence in the *Oregon Trail* video game by acknowledging the nations that live{d} along the trail and erasing English place names.
